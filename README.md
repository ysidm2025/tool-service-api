# Combined FastAPI and ASP.NET WebAPI Project

## Overview
This project contains two independent services that expose the same functionality using **FastAPI (Python)** and **ASP.NET WebAPI (C#/.NET)**. Both services allow you to interact with different tools that are dynamically loaded and executed via reflection or decorators/attributes.

Additionally, the **FastAPI service integrates OpenAI's Agent SDK (Beta)** to define and run an AI assistant that intelligently chooses and executes tools based on user input.

---

## FastAPI Service (with OpenAI Agent SDK)
- **Port**: `8000`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /bot_capabilities`: Returns metadata of available tools (functions).
  - `POST /bot_response`: Executes a tool using reflection to dynamically load and run the correct function.
  - `POST /ask_agent`: Uses the OpenAI Agent SDK to create an assistant, initiate a conversation thread, and return a response by selecting appropriate tools based on the query.

### üîç Agent SDK Features Used in `/ask_agent`
- **Assistant creation** (`client.beta.assistants.create`): Defines agent with tools, instructions, and GPT model.
- **Thread creation** (`client.beta.threads.create`): Manages ongoing conversation context.
- **Message posting** (`threads.messages.create`): Sends user query to the assistant.
- **Run execution** (`threads.runs.create_and_poll`): Triggers assistant processing and tool usage.
- **Message retrieval** (`threads.messages.list`): Gets final response generated by the assistant.
- **Tool execution**: Powered by OpenAI function-calling and executed locally based on tool name and arguments.

## ASP.NET WebAPI Service
- **Port**: `5048`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /bot_capabilities`: Returns metadata of available tools via reflection and `[FunctionTool]` attributes.
  - `POST /bot_response`: Invokes appropriate tool function with passed parameters.

## Running the Services

### ‚úÖ FastAPI (Python)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install pydantic fastapi uvicorn openai

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
  ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"

3. Run the server:
  ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
